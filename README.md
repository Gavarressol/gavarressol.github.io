## Project analysis
  
- **Distribuation**

  I organized my information into four sections: Header, About Me, Projects, and a Footer for contact details. In the Header, I included my name and professional title, as itâ€™s essential to show who I am and what I do from the start.
  
  In the About Me section, I shared a brief introduction along with a recent photo, highlighting relevant skills, knowledge areas, and languages Iâ€™m proficient in. This section is designed to give a well-rounded picture of my background and what I can bring.
  
  For the Projects section, I showcased my most significant projects to demonstrate my abilities and experience in action. Each project highlights my applied skills, providing concrete examples of my work.
  
  Lastly, I included a Footer with my contact information, inviting anyone interested to reach out for more details or potential collaboration. This structured approach ensures clear and accessible information for anyone visiting my portfolio.

- **Visual design**

  The main goal of my CV design was to make it simple, clear, and clean. With this in mind, I separated the sections using a subtle background to differentiate them without drawing too much attention. I chose a blue-and-white color scheme because I felt it best represented the clarity and simplicity I aimed for.
  
  In the projects section, I included a hover effect to signal that each project can be downloaded, making it easy for users to explore my work. Finally, I applied a darker blue shade of the primary color to the header and footer, creating a balanced contrast that adds cohesion to the overall design.
