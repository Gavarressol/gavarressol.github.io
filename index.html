            <img src="/library/ArnauHerreraSoles.png" width="200">
            <p>I am currently in my third year of studying for my degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Girona.

                Simultaneously, I work as a monitor at a school in Girona, which has allowed me to develop strong communication,
                 empathy, and teamwork skills. Additionally, I did a course where I gained knowledge about programming languages 
                 like Python and Java, and tools such as Flask and Tkinter.
                
                I hold a Technological Baccalaureate and have achieved a B2 level in English from Oxford.
